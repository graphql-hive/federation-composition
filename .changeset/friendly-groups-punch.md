Fix supergraph `@join__field` emission for Federation v1 `@external` fields and improve override/requires edge-case handling.

- Drop Federation v1 `@join__field(external: true)` fields based on key usage in the subgraph instead of aggregated field key usage across subgraphs.
- Avoid emitting redundant `@join__field(external: true)` metadata when a field is only required through overridden paths.
- Tighten `@join__field` emission around `@override` and interface type fields.
